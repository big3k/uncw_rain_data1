Passive microwave (PMW) radiometers are utilized by meteorological agencies worldwide to remotely sense precipitation from space. More than 30 PMW radiometers onboard satellites from several international agencies have been used for precipitation measurement since the 1980s, with about 15 currently operational and several follow-on missions being planned. Precipitation estimates from these radiometer observations make it possible to generate the widely used hourly/half-hour global precipitation data sets (e.g., IMERG, CMORPH, and GSMaP).

The primary research objective in Dr. Youâ€™s laboratory is to exploit the time-dimension information among these sensors, with the purpose of improving the precipitation estimation and revealing new phenomenon. Using this time-dimension concept, we (1)improved the precipitation retrieval over snow-covered land regions by brightness temperature temporal variation (Delta TB) (You et al., 2017, JHM); (2) used the emissivity temporal variation (Delta e) for rainfall retrieval enhancements  (You et al., 2018, JGR; 2021, JHM); (3) captured the liquid raindrop signature over desert regions (You et al., 2020 GRL); (4) propagated precipitation rates from conical scanning radiometers to cross-track scanning sensors (You et al., 2021, JHM)
Our current research is focused in two major areas: (1) optimally propagating and merging level-2 microwave precipitation estimates; and (2) generating satellite precipitation climate data record.
