Our current research is focused in two major areas: (1) optimally propagating and merging level-2 microwave precipitation estimates; and (2) generating satellite precipitation climate data record. We are also part of the NASA Precipitation Measurement Missions (PMM) Land Surface Working Group (<a href="http://lswg.uncw.edu">LSWG</a>).    <br><br>  

(1) <b>Optimally propagating and merging level-2 microwave precipitation estimates</b> <br> <br>

Our work validation work (You et al., 2020) showed over ocean, conical scanning sensors outperform cross-track scanning radiometers, primarily due to the usage of low-frequency channels. Over land all sensors perform similarly except the noticeably worse performance from ATMS and SSMIS-F17. <br><br>

Based on this result (i.e., conical being better than cross-track sensor over ocean), we demonstrated a novel approach to improve precipitation rates at the cross-track scanning radiometers’ observation time by propagating the conical scanning radiometers’ retrievals to the cross-track scanning radiometers’ observation time. The improved precipitation rate is a weighted average of original cross-track radiometers’ retrievals and retrievals propagated from a conical scanning radiometer. <br><br>

Currently, we are working to optimize the weighting function between the propagated precipitation rate from conical sensors and the original cross-track sensors’ precipitation rates. This work is supported by two NASA grants. <br><br>

Black curves in each plot represent the GMI swath boundaries. <br><br> 

(2) <b>Generating satellite climate data record</b> <br> <br> 

We routinely deliver the calibrated Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) Brightness Temperature (TB) Climate Data Record (CDR), and a suite of environmental data record (e.g., rainfall, land surface emissivity, and sea ice coverage) to NOAA. The data are at approximately 48km global resolution with 30 observations per scan, using the “window” channels covering 23, 31, 50, and 89GHz. Data are subject to visual inspections and calibration correction verification. The final record extends from 1998–present.
Currently, we are working to connecting the TB record from AMSU/MHS with ATMS. This work is supported by NOAA.
